# Trie_Implementation_Python
Produced code with the following functionality:
1. Implements a trie using a linked structure (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).
2. Be able to add words and find words.
3. Find all words in the trie that contain the letters "ar". The letters must be contiguous in the
word. For example, "hardware" does contain the letters "ar" contiguously but the word "batter" does not.
4. Print out all words in the trie
